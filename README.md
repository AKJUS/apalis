# Apalis [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geofmureithi/apalis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geofmureithi/apalis)

Apalis is a simple, extensible multithreaded background job processing library for Rust.

## Features

- Simple and predictable job handling model.
- Jobs handlers with a macro free API.
- Take full advantage of the [`tower`] ecosystem of
  middleware, services, and utilities.
- Workers take full of the actor model.
- Fully Tokio compatible.
- Optional Web interface to help you manage your jobs.

Apalis job processing is powered by [`tower::Service`] which means you have access to the [`tower`] and [`tower-http`] middleware.

Apalis has support for

- Redis
- SQlite
- PostgresSQL
- MySQL
- Bring Your Own Job Source eg Cron or Twitter streams

## Getting Started

To get started, just add to Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
apalis = { version = "0.3.1", features = ["redis"] }
```

## Usage

```rust
use apalis::{redis::RedisStorage, JobError, JobRequest, JobResult, WorkerBuilder, Storage, Monitor, JobContext};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Email {
    to: String,
}

async fn email_service(job: Email, _ctx: JobContext) -> Result<JobResult, JobError> {
    Ok(JobResult::Success)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    std::env::set_var("RUST_LOG", "debug");
    env_logger::init();
    let redis = std::env::var("REDIS_URL").expect("Missing env variable REDIS_URL");
    let storage = RedisStorage::new(redis).await.unwrap();
    Monitor::new()
        .register_with_count(2, move || {
            WorkerBuilder::new(storage.clone())
                .build_fn(email_service)
        })
        .run()
        .await
}

```

Then

```rust
//This can be in another part of the program or another application
async fn produce_route_jobs(storage: &RedisStorage<Email>) {
    let mut storage = storage.clone();
    storage
        .push(Email {
            to: "test@example.com".to_string(),
        })
        .await
        .unwrap();
}

```

### Web UI

If you are running [Apalis Board](https://github.com/geofmureithi/apalis-board), you can easily manage your jobs. See a working [Rest API here](https://github.com/geofmureithi/apalis/tree/master/examples/rest-api)

## Storage Comparison

Since we provide a few storage solutions, here is a table comparing them:

| Feature         | Redis | Sqlite | Postgres | Sled | Mysql | Mongo |
| :-------------- | :---: | :----: | :------: | :--: | ----- | ----- |
| Scheduled jobs  |   âœ“   |   âœ“    |    âœ“     |  x   | âœ“     | x     |
| Retryable jobs  |   âœ“   |   âœ“    |    âœ“     |  x   | âœ“     | x     |
| Persistence     |   âœ“   |   âœ“    |    âœ“     |  x   | âœ“     | x     |
| Rerun Dead jobs |   âœ“   |   âœ“    |    âœ“     |  x   | \*    | x     |
